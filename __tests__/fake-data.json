    "description": "New York City-based comedian and actor Todd Barry is widely recognized for his roles as the bongo-playing “Third Conchord” on HBO’s Flight of the Conchords and Mickey Rourke’s deli boss in 2009 Oscar winner The Wrestler, and renowned throughout the entertainment industry for his nuanced, measured, and thoroughly original approach to stand-up. Drawing audience members in with his deadpan self-deprecation and ability to pile punchline upon punchline, his decidedly low-key stage persona belies a deeply intelligent, often biting, occasionally absurdist worldview, one lauded by discerning fans who seek a fresh yet honest update to traditional observation and social commentary. <br /><br /><br />Boasting multiple stand-up appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and two Comedy Central Presents specials,  and his latest one hour Comedy Central special Super Crazy. Todd’s resume also includes such hit TV shows as Louie, Delocated, Bored to Death, Tim and Eric, Chappelle’s Show, Sex and the City, and even Sesame Street. Among his additional feature-film highlights are Todd Phillips’s Road Trip, Louis CK’s Pootie Tang, and Mitch Hedberg’s Los Enchiladas.  You can see him soon at Sigourney Weaver's right hand man in Amy Heckerling's Vamps, and as Paul Rudd's co-worker in David Wain's Wanderlust. Internationally he has performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Montreal’s Just For Laughs Festival, the Vancouver International Comedy Festival, and Kilkenny, Ireland’s Cat Laughs Festival.  <br /><br /><br />Todd has been heard on both The Howard Stern Show and The Bob &amp; Tom Show, and his albums Medium Energy, Falling Off the Bone, and From Heaven are available from Comedy Central Records, Amazon and iTunes. He has earned the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival’s Jury Award, praise from Ricky Gervais as one of the best comedians of 2009, and accolades from The Onion’s A.V. Club, which declared Medium Energy one of the best comedy albums of the decade. <br /><br /><br />Todd was the subject of a recent New York Times Arts section cover story, which referred to him as a “master of standup” and noted “when it comes to live performance, few comics are more consistently funny.”<br /><br /><br />In April 2013 the Todd Barry Podcast debuted. It reached #1 on the iT<br /><br /><br /> “Comedy savants revere this Conan and Letterman veteran’s hushed, singsong sarcasm.” – Entertainment Weekly<br /><br /><br />“Piercing, blinding, slaying, violating wit.” – NPR<br /><br /><br />“Infuses his observational comedy with a wonderfully individual disdain.” – The Times of London<br /><br /><br />“He doesn't suffer fools, and fortunately for his comedy his definition of ‘fool’ doesn't discriminate.” – Pitchfork.com<br /><br /><br /> “Acerbic wit, deadpan delivery and wickedly smart punchlines.” – Time Out New York<br /><br /><br />“Barry is so beautifully arid he is positively parched.” – London Evening Standard<br /><br /><br />“The success lies with the delivery, and in his ability to seamlessly merge ad-libbed material with his prepared schtick.” – The Age, Melbourne",

    "description": "Stand-up comic, actor, writer, director Pauly Shore tasted super-stardom in 1990 when his precedent-setting MTV show &quot;Totally Pauly&quot; hit the airwaves to major fan approval. The show ran for six years, leading him to television and film roles. In 1993, he wrote and starred in a one-hour HBO television special, Pauly Does Dallas, which drew in even more loyal fans.<br /><br />He had roles in films from 1988, providing supporting comedy relief, but it was the wildly popular Encino Man (1992), partnered with Sean Astin and Brendan Fraser, that put Pauly on the map. Films followed, including Son in Law (1993), In the Army Now (1994), Jury Duty (1995), Bio-Dome (1996) and The Curse of Inferno (1997). He provided voices in animated features such as Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and The Goofy Movie Franchise (1995/2000).<br /><br />His first album, &quot;The Future of America,&quot; was named Best Comedy Album by the college music journalists in 1991, while the National Association of Record Merchandisers nominated his second album, &quot;Scraps from the Future,&quot; for a Best Sellers Award.<br />Pauly has made several appearances in recent years as a recurring guest on Howard Stern's late-night show, as well as David Letterman's talk show. He tours the country with his stand-up comedy act.<br /><br />In 2003, Shore produced, wrote, directed and starred in Pauly Shore Is Dead, a semi-autobiographical mockumentary, and in 2005 starred in the reality television series Minding the Store. His production company, Landing Patch Productions, has produced multiple films and specials: Natural Born Komics (2007), Adopted (2009), Vegas Is My Oyster (2011), and Pauly~tics (2012).<br /><br />Currently, Pauly is working on Pauly Shore Stands Alone, a true-life road documentary that follows him as he performs in obscure towns throughout Wisconsin while dealing with his personal life back home. Pauly is also debuting a podcast series later this year: Pauly Shore’s Interested. In it, he interviews Arsenio Hall, Chris Rock, Whitney Cummings, Former RNC Chair Michael Steele, Dodger’s pitcher Brian Wilson, and many many more.",

Don is a modern suburban dad just trying to raise his kids and get through the day with a bit of money in the bank and a scrap of dignity intact. With a unique style that can best be described as frenetic and engaging, Don captures the irony of parenting, marriage and everyday absurdities through characters, voices, parodies and some of the best written routines around. He’s a wanna-be geek who constantly upgrades to the latest technology, but can never get it to work, leading to signature bits about tech support, Idiots Guides, texting and passwords. Friesen has recently taken his smart, savvy, and highly-caffeinated comedy to the stage at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, CA, for the taping of his new Showtime one-hour special titled &quot;Ask Your Mom.&quot; In his first nationally released concert special, Don delivers a winning hour of clever, true-to-life “he’s talking about my family up there” comedy that manages to be adult-smart yet family-friendly.",

From sex, to sports, to booze, when a dwarf and a Jew come together the results are unpredictable but always entertaining.<br /><br />Adam Ray<br />Born and raised in the suburbs of Lake Forest Park, WA, Adam got into comedy at an early age, impersonating friends, teachers, and Ace Ventura.<br /><br />In High School, Adam ran his high school’s morning television news program. When it began, it was your basic morning news program. Then Adam and a few friends took it over, and slowly turned it into a weekly sketch show that somehow included the news. Airing every Friday morning for 10 minutes, it was a hit amongst the entire school.<br /><br />In 2001, Adam journeyed to Los Angeles, where he was accepted into the BFA acting conservatory at USC. His junior year he studied abroad in London at the British American Drama Academy.<br /><br />After graduating from the acting school at USC in Los Angeles, Adam has been seen guest starring on “Two Broke Girls,” “WORKAHOLICS,” “Arrested Development,” “According to Jim,” Adult Swim’s “NTSF:SD:SUV,” and this June you can see him opposite Sandra Bullock &amp; Melissa McCarthy in Paul Feig’s new buddy cop comedy “The Heat.”  Aside from his standup and writing for MTV’s “PUNKD,” Adam has over 30 million views on his comedy sketches that he writes and produces weekly on AdamRayTV.com.<br /><br />Brad Williams possesses something that everyone can agree is funny: a disability. Brad is a dwarf. He has appeared on numerous TV shows including Legit, Live at Gotham, the Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Mind Of Mencia, and Pitboss. Brad has also performed for the troops all over the world because soldiers think dwarfs are funny too.<br /><br />Brad’s show is high energy. Robin Williams called him “Prozac with a head.” Brad’s ability to make humorous observations on disability, relationships, sex, and race are winning over audiences and proving that anyone can overcome their shortcomings.",

    "description": "Indie film icon, Jason Mewes, is perhaps best known as the vocal half of the on-screen comedic duo, Jay and Silent Bob. Mewes’ has reprised his role as celebrated character, “Jay,” in a number of hit films. With cult-fans following his controversial antics, Mewes has captured audiences with rebellious banter against his unspoken other half and longtime friend, Kevin Smith (Silent Bob). Since the beginning of the duo’s offbeat work together, Mewes and Smith have continued to build on their beloved character driven roles from the Jay and Silent Bob series.  <br /><br />Mewes is the Creative Producer at SModCo Internet Radio (SIR), which launched in May 2011, as well as the Creative Producer at SModCo Internet TV (SIT), which launched in May 2012 and lives online as a YouTube channel. SModco produces Mewes’ weekly video blog called, Mewes Views, which was also the first SIT video to air.  <br /><br />Mewes recently wrapped Spoilers, alongside Smith in an ambitious online show airing on Hulu. The new show’s unique premise begins with watching a brand new movie with the studio audience, and then opening up the floor for verbal blogging in a free-for-all group chat. The show aims to interact, engage, debate and connect with people who have a similar passion for movies and pop culture. Spoilers will be a Hulu Original Series. In 2011, Mewes co-hosted the TV series, Cinema Enema, which also reviews film in an off-kilter way.  <br /><br />To date, Mewes’ podcast with Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Get Old, completed its 95th episode and is fast approaching #100. Mewes has taken the success of this series and executive produced the DVD version entitled, Jay and Silent Bob Get Old: Teabagging in the UK, which is set to come out July 2012 and is currently available in the UK.  <br /><br />In film as an actor, Mewes is starring in the Wunderkind Pictures feature, Noobz, an indie “gamers” film about four friends and Gears of Wars players who embark on a quest to survive a road trip and win a Gamecon Championship. Jason stars alongside Casper Van Dien, Blake Freeman, Moises Arias, Mindy Sterling, and Jon Gries in the film written and directed by Blake Freeman, with Marvin Wilson as a co-writer. Mewes is also currently in post-production on the film, Rock Jocks, about a group of dysfunctional government employees who find themselves responsible for shooting down an asteroid on track for the Earth.  <br /><br />Mewes’ most noted film credits include: Smith’s award-winning Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Clerks II, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. This string of cult hits all celebrated and continued Mewes’ infamous role as “Jay,” a bawdy, fast talking, and over sexed but very likable guy. For his successful and brow-raising portrayal, MTV honored him with 2007's Dirtiest Mouth Award.  <br /><br />In 2010, Jason appeared in the mobster comedy, The Last Godfather, alongside Harvey Keitel and Blake Clark, in which he played, “Vinnie,” a Mafia boss who trains his mentally impaired son as his successor. In 2012 Mewes stars as the lead in the comedy Money Shot, in which he played “The Pimp” that gets even. Mewes also plays Ben Shapiro in the feature K-11, directed by Jules Stewart currently in post production.",

You've seen Trae’s Liberal Redneck viral videos, you've read their weekly blog (https://oursundybest.wordpress.com/) and now you'll see them at their best - performing stand up comedy. <br /><br />Trae Crowder: @traecrowder<br />Recently earning national attention (or notoriety, depending on your viewpoint) for his &quot;Liberal Redneck&quot; series of viral videos, Trae Crowder has been performing his particular brand of Southern-fried intellectual comedy in the Southeast and beyond for the past six years. Trae is also a writer and is currently a member of NBC Universal's Talent Infusion Program after being invited to their prestigious Late Night Writer's Workshop in 2015. <br /><br />Drew Morgan: @averagedrew<br />Hailing from rural East Tennessee, Drew draws on his experiences as a small-town son of a preacher man who has lived in Africa, Australia, Miami, Boston, and (currently) New York City. Weaving his stories together with observations on culture, religion, and identity, he's like Mark Twain on acid, or maybe just a confused Southerner pretending to have his shit together. He is a good dancer. <br /><br />Corey Ryan Forrester (CoFo): @coreyfcomedy<br />Corey has been writing and performing stand up comedy since the age of sixteen - before he could legally work in a comedy club. His North Georgia roots have given Corey an affinity for Southern wit and storytelling. He may often wear a PBR hat, but don't assume there is anything blue collar about him. CoFo has thoughts on everything from race to religion, politics and gender. He loves women and cheese. All dairy, actually.",

    "description": "History buff and comedian Dave Anthony was considering starting a new podcast in<br />2014. His idea was to write up an unknown story from American history and read it to a different comedian each week. Having not heard of the story before, Dave hoped the comedian’s reaction would be hilarious. He gave it a go and his first guest was comedian Gareth Reynolds. They immediately clicked and fans flooded social media telling Dave to never change the co-host. <br />And he didn’t. Sticking to the formula of Dave reading Gareth a story he has never heard, The Dollop quickly shot up the charts. Fans of both comedy and history were drawn to the wild stories and quick improv skills of Gareth. With millions of downloads, The Dollop has become a regular presence on top of the podcast charts, as well as selling out shows in both the US and Australia.",

    "description": "The Woman! The Comic! The Legend!<br />Margaret Cho was born Dec. 5, 1968 and raised in San Francisco. “It was different than any other place on Earth,” she says. “I grew up and went to grammar school on Haight Street during the ’70s. There were old hippies, ex-druggies, burnouts from the ’60s, drag queens, and Chinese people. To say it was a melting pot – that’s the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time.”<br /><br />Her grandfather was a Methodist minister who ran an orphanage in Seoul during the Korean War. Ignoring the traditions of her patriarchal culture, her mother bravely resisted an arranged marriage in Korea and married Margaret’s father who writes joke books – in Korean. “Books like 1001 Jokes for Public Speakers – real corny stuff,” Cho says. “I guess we’re in the same line of work. But we don’t understand each other that way. I don’t know why the things he says are funny and the same for him.”<br /><br />What Margaret did know is that she didn’t love being a kid. Racing toward adulthood to escape bullying, she began writing jokes at 14 and professionally performing at age 16. Getting picked on, and feeling disenfranchised, is a subject that’s very near to Margaret’s heart. She has become a sort of “Patron Saint” for Outsiders, speaking for them when they are not able to speak for themselves Along with advocating for gay rights and bullying, Margaret recently began working with Homeless people on the streets of San Francisco as a tribute to her dear friend, Robin Williams.<br /><br />Soon after starting her Stand Up career, Margaret won a comedy contest where first prize was opening for Jerry Seinfeld. She moved to Los Angeles in the early ’90s and, still in her early twenties, hit the college circuit, where she immediately became the most booked act in the market and garnered a nomination for “Campus Comedian of The Year.” She performed over 300 concerts within two years. Arsenio Hall introduced her to late night audiences, Bob Hope put her on a prime time special and, seemingly overnight, Margaret Cho became a national celebrity.<br /><br />Her groundbreaking, controversial, and short-lived ABC sitcom, All-American Girl (1994) soon followed. Oddly, while chosen because of who she was – a non-conformist Korean American woman with liberal views – the powers-that-be then decided they wanted her to “tone it down” for the show. Challenging Margaret’s feelings for both who she was and how she looked, she soon realized that though she was an Executive Producer, it was a battle she would not win. “For fear of being too “ethnic,” the show got so watered down for television that by the end, it was completely lacking in the essence of what I am and what I do.”<br /><br />The experience was a traumatic one, bringing up unresolved feelings left over from childhood, and Margaret developed an eating disorder as a response to criticism about her body. She was so obsessive in her goal to try to be what she thought others wanted, she landed in the hospital with kidney failure. Through out a period of self-abuse, Margaret continued performing to sold-out audiences across the country in comedy clubs, theaters, and on college campuses, working to channel her anger in to something more positive.<br /><br />In 1999, her groundbreaking, off Broadway one-woman show, I’m The One That I Want, toured the country to national acclaim and was made into a best-selling book and feature film of the same name. After her experience with All-American Girl, Margaret wanted to make sure she would only have to answer to herself, making sure she was responsible for the distribution and sales of her film. The concert film, which garnered incredible reviews, broke records for ‘Most money grossed per print’ in movie history. In 2001, after the success of her first tour, Cho launched Notorious C.H.O., a smash-hit 37-city national tour that culminated in a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. Notorious C.H.O., hailed by the New York Times as “Brilliant!”, was recorded and released as a feature film. Both films were acquired by Showtime Cable Networks, and produced by Margaret’s production company, a testament to the success of Margaret’s bold business model.<br /><br />In March of 2003, Margaret embarked on her third sold-out national tour, Revolution. It was heralded by the Chicago Sun Times as “Her strongest show yet” and the CD recording was nominated for a Grammy for Comedy Album of the Year. In 2005, Cho released Assassin, which The Chicago Tribune crowed “Packs passion in to each punch.” The concert film premiered in select theatres and on the gay and lesbian premium channel Here! TV.<br /><br />In 2007, Margaret hit the road with Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Harry and Erasure, along with indie faves The Dresden Dolls and The Cliks, to host the True Colors Tour, benefiting the Human Rights Campaign. A true entertainment pioneer, Margaret also created and starred in The Sensuous Woman, a live variety show featuring vaudevillian burlesque and comedy, which she took for an extended off-Broadway run in the fall.<br /><br />Margaret returned to TV in 2008 on the VH1 series, The Cho Show. Describing it as a ‘reality sitcom,’ Margaret said at the time, “It’s the closest I’ve been able to come on television to what I do as a comic.” The Cho Show followed Margaret, her real parents, and her eccentric entourage through a series of irreverent and outrageous experiences, shaped by Margaret’s ‘anything goes’ brand of stand-up.<br /><br />The aptly titled Beautiful came next, exploring the good, bad and ugly in beauty, and the unattractive marketers who shape our world. The concert premiered in Australia at The Sydney Theater, marking the first time Margaret debuted a tour abroad. While touring through the US, the concert was filmed at the Long Beach theatre, aired as a special on Showtime in 2009, and then released as both a DVD and a book. Venus Zine hailed Margaret, and the show, saying “her fierce activism, which addresses bigger issues such as what it’s like to be demoralized by your country and culture…(left) no subject too taboo for the fearless stand-up queen.”<br /><br />In 2009 Margaret nabbed a starring role in the comedy/drama series Drop Dead Diva, which aired for six seasons on the Lifetime network. Margaret enjoyed being part of a team, and not necessarily having the sole responsibility for keeping things afloat. “(Drop Dead Diva) was very fulfilling. It’s a lot about the things I talk about, like body image, and women feeling good about themselves, and learning to be visible.”<br /><br />Never one to shy away from a challenge, Margaret stepped right up to the proverbial plate when asked to do Season 11 of the highly- rated Dancing with the Stars. Paired with pro Louie Van Amstel, Margaret was on one of the show’s most controversial seasons. “I really wanted to do DWTS so much. I love the show and I love dancing. It seemed like it would be very exciting, which it was. It was also very difficult because I was touring as well.” Margaret got a very strong reaction to her Rainbow Dancing Dress during a time when the issue of bullying, especially among gay teens, was all over the media. “I am very proud to have been able to wear a gay pride dress on a show that is so conservative. It is a wonderful thing to have every one remember me by. I wanted to send an urgent message to gay teenagers to make them feel included and loved. That dress was my statement to them about pride.”<br /><br />2010 culminated with another high honor, a second Grammy Award nomination for Comedy Album of the Year for Cho Dependent, her incredibly funny collection of music featuring collaborations with Fiona Apple, Andrew Bird, Grant Lee Phillips, Tegan &amp; Sara, Ben Lee and more. The album received critical acclaim, with The Oregonian stating, “This was a chance to see and hear an already drop-dead funny diva growing, flexing new musical muscle, and fearlessly mature.” The album is funny, yes, but also quite musical, featuring not only her surprisingly strong singing voice, but her skill on the guitar, banjo and dulcimer. “I was inspired to make beautiful music with a comic edge.  I took this very seriously, taking vocal and guitar lessons while I was touring. I was very devoted to learning and understanding how I could accompany myself.”<br /><br />Margaret self released Cho Dependent on her own Clownery Records, and was encouraged by the acclaim, as there are only a handful of people putting out albums of comedy music – “Weird” Al Yankovic, Flight of the Conchords, The Lonely Island, to name a few – but no women. In 2011, Margaret released the live concert film of Cho Dependent, which also had its cable network debut on Showtime. Audiences who caught these performances live can attest that Cho hasn’t lost any of her edge. Shot at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, GA, Cho remains uncensored, taking aim at the Palin family, her stint on Dancing With the Stars, smoking pot and living in a world with ‘sexting.’  The DVD is characteristically no-holds-barred Margaret and instantly a classic.<br /><br />In 2012, Margaret spent whatever free time she had crafting her all new standup show, the uproariously and aptly named MOTHER, which kicked off with both a US and European tour. According to Margaret, “MOTHER offers up an untraditional look at motherhood and how we look at maternal figures and strong women in queer culture. There’s nothing we don’t discuss, including race, drugs, sexuality – gay-straight-everything in between, celebrity, culture, politics – nothing is sacred – least of all this MOTHER.”<br /><br />Paradox not lost, Margaret had to re-schedule some of the shows she had booked mid-September so she could attend the Emmy Awards with her mother. Nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her hilarious stint on 30 Rock as gender-bending North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, Margaret was thrilled with the role and the nomination, and with Tina Fey. “Tina and I did a pilot together, Cabot College, and I was so happy to be working with her again. She is such a force, and I am grateful to know her.  I will take any opportunity to team up with her.“<br /><br />Although the pilot wasn’t picked up, Margaret’s creative side is moving ahead at full speed.  First up – honoring her late friend, Robin Williams. “I found I couldn’t stop grieving Robin.  He was an idol of mine before he became a friend, and he was an amazing advocate for homeless people, raising over 70 million dollars for homeless Men, Women and Children through the Comic Relief comedy Specials. He’d also stipulate in his movie contracts that a certain percent of the crew had to be homeless. Robin was a naturally compassionate man and he understood implicitly that what these people needed was to be treated with dignity.” When the sadness of his passing overwhelmed Margaret, a mutual friend told her not to grieve Robin, but to ‘Be Robin’. The hashtag #BeRobin was born, and Margaret began setting up shop in different places in and around San Francisco, putting the information of where she’d be on her Facebook and Twitter pages. “It’s very simple, all I do and create a distraction – comedy and music – for several hours. The generosity of people has amazed me. Hairdressers and nail technicians have come down to give services to the Homeless community, we’ve had incredible food donations, sanitary supplies for women, clothing, money and more. Our motto is ‘If you have, give; if you need, take.” Margaret has a GoFundMe page for the project: Http://GoFundMe.com/BeRobin.<br /><br />Incredibly, the #BeRobin project has led to more music from Margaret. She recently decided that her next two albums worth of material would be an outgrowth of the work she’s doing for the homeless community. “I am performing some new songs with the #BeRobin events, and wasn’t really sure how I was going to release my next set of music. I was waiting to see what the right thing was, and this presented itself.” Margaret takes her musicianship very seriously, taking lessons, practicing and working with top musicians. Produced by David Garza and Garrison Starr, the next album will be a comedy-music hybrid not unlike Cho Dependent.  “I have so many friends in music, and it’s such a big part of my social life, so I am always recording and finding ideas for songs. Now I have a plan, and all the proceeds will benefit this cause.”<br /><br />Margaret is also excited about the new talk show she has debuting on TLC in January called All About SEX. Margaret is part of the panel of hosts that include comedian Heather McDonald and actress Marissa Jaret Winokur. “All About SEX is a late night talk show where viewers call in and ask questions about sex. I cover sex toys and alternative sexuality. I understand that world from the inside. In fact, I was on the Board of Good Vibrations, a pioneering sex toy store for women that removed the stigma of women not only buying sex toys, but experimenting with what makes them feel good.”<br /><br />2015 also brings Margaret back to the Stand Up stage, as she films her next comedy special, There’s no I in Team, but There is a Cho in Psycho, at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City in March. “This show is about insanity, about the anger I feel about everything happening in the world right now, from police brutality to racism to the rising tide of violence against women. I think everyone has a feeling about that mania and that rage. This show is the advanced version of MOTHER, the Wolf Mother.” One of the things Margaret is most excited for is the artwork for the show, a portrait she commissioned that was painted entirely in her own blood. “The artist Vincent Castiglia did an amazing portrait of me using my blood. I found it to be very symbolic since There’s no I in Team, but There is a Cho in Psycho has a lot to do with anger, rage and blood letting. It’s a very beautiful portrait and I am really proud of it.”<br /><br />With so much going on in her artistic life, Margaret has never turned away from the causes that are important to her. She is incredibly active in anti-racism, anti-bullying and gay rights campaigns, and has been recognized for her unwavering dedication. She was the recipient of the Victory Fund’s 2008 Leadership Award and the first ever Best Comedy Performance Award at the 2007 Asian Excellence Awards. She also received the First Amendment Award from the ACLU of Southern California, and the Intrepid Award from the National Organization for Women (NOW). Throughout her career, she has been honored by GLAAD, American Women in Radio and Television, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), and PFLAG for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for all, regardless of race, sexual orientation or gender identity. In June of 2011, Margaret was honored by LA Pride, receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing an individual whose lifetime body of work has left a lasting major imprint on the LGBT community.<br /><br />Through her hard work, Margaret has had the opportunity to be heard, to extend her point of view and become regarded as a true pioneer in her field. She takes none of it for granted. “It’s a wonderful thing to be known as a ‘safe haven’ for people. A lot people who come to my shows don’t necessarily consider themselves traditional comedy fans. I seem to be a safe alternative for people who don’t think they’re being represented in society. They come because my point of view satisfies a lot of what needs to be said out there, and that makes me really proud.”",

    "description": "arah Tiana has been a “working” comedian/ex-waitress in Los Angeles since 2003.  Originally from Calhoun, GA, Sarah’s act emphasizes the thrills of growing up after “The War Of Northern Aggression” and trying to survive in the current battle of the sexes.  She doesn’t call herself “single,”  (she’s too old for that), she prefers to be called “sexually active.” <br /> <br />Sarah’s big break came after she was recognized for her “breakout performance” as Carmen in four episodes of Reno 911!’s 7th season.  In 2005 she helped create a sketch comedy company called The Strait Jacket Society as a way to help young actors in Hollywood accelerate their stage time and gain exposure while still having fun (she has currently put over 500 actors through the program).   A downright ‘Merican, Sarah has done over 10 tours of comedy for the troops including Germany, Singapore, Afghanistan, Guam, Okinawa, and several Wounded Warrior Facilities.  <br /> <br />A trip to Iraq at the beginning of the war is highlighted in the documentary film, “We Love You Mrs. Bevins.” Sarah recently wrote and starred in “The Burn” with Jeffrey Ross for 2 seasons on Comedy Central. She is currently a correspondent on “The Soup Investigates” and a regular on the “Chelsea Lately” roundtable.  <br /> <br />An avid sports fan Sarah wrote for the ESPY awards and the Rob Riggle NFL segments on Fox.  She can also be seen at The World Famous Comedy Store, Twitter, and numerous unhealthy relationships in and around Los Angeles.  She will never be seen in the three pilots she taped last year or be caught dead in the dress she wore on Craig Ferguson (it no longer fits).",

His infectious, explosive energy onstage, insightful jokes, and family-inspired humor crosses all boundaries. In 2007, Variety magazine named Jo Koy one of the “10 Comics to Watch!”<br />Raised in Tacoma, Washington, Jo credits his mother for his comedic and acting talents. Encouraged by his mom, Jo participated in school talent shows and presented impromptu performances for his family and friends. This loving support led to the Las Vegas coffee house, and inspired a move to Los Angeles.<br />In 2005, Jo hit the “opportunity of a lifetime” with a performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He became one of a select few ever to receive a standing ovation. Since then, he has appeared several times throughout the years.<br />A single father, Jo Koy was inspired by his son and began working on his first Comedy Central special “Don’t Make Him Angry,” which aired in January 2009. His much- anticipated second Comedy Central special “Lights Out” aired in October 2012, and is now available on DVD.<br />Jo has appeared on various VH1 I Love series, as well as The Joy Behar Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Call with Carson Daly, and Jamie Foxx: Laffapalooza. He is a regular headlining comedian at the world famous Improv, tours the college circuit nationwide, and performs in comedy clubs both in the U.S., and internationally.

His high-energy thoughts on family, Work, and humor, as well as watching his subjects on stage, leave many an audience rolling in the aisles!<br /><br />Shawn was a Police Officer for ten years before he realized that he did not fit the  COP  profile.  With a dislike for doughnuts and coffee and a unique ability to make people laugh while dealing with the public, he was soon outcast by his peers.<br /><br />Shawn soon realized that Being a Cop and Being a Comedian / Hypnotist is the same job.... Either way he gets paid to mess with people. However he always makes sure that his subject feel comfortable and have as good a time (if not a better time) than the people watching in the audience.<br /><br />Shawn s point-blank humor is mostly clean, and he is capable of picking topics that everyone can relate to.  Shawn gets most of his material from awkward or ridiculous things he s experienced. His stage Hypnosis show takes his comedic perspective to a whole new level never before seen, both with his subjects as well as his own interjections.\r\n                                                            \r\n                                <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hilarioushypnosis.com/\">more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a>",

    "description": "Perhaps best known as the comedian who puts the cerebral in Cerebral Palsy, Josh Blue centers much of his self-deprecating act around his disability. He exploded onto the national comedy scene by capturing the attention and endearment of the country as the winner of NBC’s Last Comic Standing.  Having already established himself as one of the most sought after comedians on the college circuit, his weekly appearances on Last Comic in the summer of 2006 expanded his fan base exponentially.  Josh starred in Comedy Central Presents: Josh Blue, which received rave reviews from fans and critics alike and was named the 11th best special on the network in 2011.  Most recently, Josh debuted a one-hour Showtime special, Sticky Change, where he cracks jokes and tells stories about everything from being a white African-American, to dealing with cabbies who think he'll pay in sticky change.  The special is currently available on Netflix.  He has appeared twice on Ron White’s Comedy Salute to the Troops on CMT and recently made his late night television debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.<br /> <br />Possessed with an undeniable likeability and comedic timing that belies his youthfulness; Josh continues to break down stereotypes of people with disabilities one laugh at a time.  His stand-up routine is in a constant state of evolution and his off-the-cuff improvisational skills guarantee that no two shows are exactly alike.<br /><br />Josh has appeared as a regular guest star on Comedy Central’s Mind of Mencia and his story has been featured on Fox, CBS, ABC, and MSNBC.  He was the first comedian to perform stand-up on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, was named Best Winning Reality Show Guest for his appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly, and made a standout guest appearance on Comics Unleashed.  He became the first comic to debut a stand-up special on the big screen when 7 More Days in the Tank was shown in theatres across the country.  Blue is set to appear in the sports based comedy 108 Stitches.  Portions of the performance also aired on Bravo Network as a half-hour comedy special.  Josh is a repeat guest on such nationally syndicated radio programs as NPR’s Talk of the Nation and The Mancow Show and has been featured in numerous print publications including People Magazine and The New York Times.  Josh has also performed at the prestigious HBO-Aspen Comedy Festival, Comedy Central’s South Beach Comedy Festival, and The Comedy Festival in Las Vegas.  Josh has even become quite an Internet sensation with his top two YouTube videos over 3.5 million plays.<br /> <br />Josh was also a member of the US Paralympic Soccer Team and competed in Athens at the Paralympic Games, the world’s second largest sporting event.  Josh is a single father living in Denver, CO with his son, Simon and daughter, Seika.",

    "description": "Steve-O (a.k.a. Stephen Glover) has become a household name and it all started when he snatched a video camera from his father’s closet when he was fifteen years old. From there he started producing homemade skateboarding videos featuring dangerous stunts mixed with comical behavior.<br /><br />He was born in London and by the age of twelve, had lived in five countries and communicated fluently in three different languages. He holds citizenship in three countries - the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.<br /><br />After finishing high school in London, and completing a year at the University of Miami, Steve-O realized that college wasn’t for him. He enrolled in Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Clown College to help further his goal of becoming a professional stuntman. After graduating Clown College, and determined to make it in Hollywood, he began to pitch his home videos to producers.<br /><br />Eventually, Steve-O’s videos made it into the hands of Jeff Tremaine (Jackass Creator/Director/Producer) who was working with Johnny Knoxville to create a stunt based reality show. The rest is history. MTV aired the first season of JACKASS in 2000. In 2001, Steve-O launched his own “Steve-O Don’t Try This At Home Tour”, establishing himself as an accomplished stage performer, at venues throughout the U.S. and in a dozen countries.<br /><br />When the JACKASS TV series ended in 2002, the team moved on to JACKASS: THE MOVIE, released by Paramount in October of that year. Shortly thereafter, Steve-O and fellow JACKASS alum, Chris Pontius, were given a spin-off show entitled WILDBOYZ, which aired on MTV and MTV2 and lasted four seasons. In 2006, Paramount released JACKASS: NUMBER 2 in theaters and Steve-O continued to thrill audiences with his outrageous stunts.<br /><br />In 2009 he competed on ABC’s hit show, DANCING WITH THE STARS, and lasted six weeks, despite an injury and having virtually no dancing ability whatsoever.<br /><br />In 2010, Paramount released JACKASS: 3D. Since then, Steve-O has become a New York Times Bestselling Author with the release of his memoir, ‘Professional Idiot,’ and has established himself as a force in the world of stand-up comedy. Thus far (and still counting), his career as a performer has brought him to a total of 38 countries, and his first hour-long comedy special, GUILTY AS CHARGED, recently premiered on Showtime and performed in the top one percent of all Showtime comedy specials.<br /><br />Most importantly, however, Steve-O has been clean and sober since March of 2008 and lives a healthy, vegan lifestyle in the Los Angeles area...but he still has no problem stapling his balls to his leg.",
